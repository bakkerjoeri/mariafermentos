  ## Sourdough bread workshop


  During this workshop I will teach you the process of making a **basic
  sourdough loaf from scratch**. You will go hands on to make, shape and bake
  the dough, and you'll go home with a delicious fresh loaf! Since this
  fermentation process is completely natural the duration of this workshop is
  around **5 hours**, and we usually start in the morning. Don't worry --
  **snacks and drinks are provided** to help you keep the energy up!


  Due to the current situation, I have stopped planning workshops for the time
  being, but I am looking forward to resuming as soon as it's safe for
  everyone's health!


  In the meantime, follow my adventures on
  [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mariafermentos/). I am baking and
  cooking more than ever!


  Take care and hopefully see you soon,


  Mariafermentos
