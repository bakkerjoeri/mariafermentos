  During this workshop I will teach you the process of making a **basic
  sourdough loaf from scratch**. You will go hands on to make, shape and bake
  the dough, and you'll go home with a fresh loaf! Since this fermentation
  process is completely natural the duration of this workshop is around **4 to 5
  hours**, and we usually start in the morning. Don't worry -- **snacks and
  drinks are provided** to help you keep the energy up! Signing up costs
  **35EUR**.


  ## Dates:


  * 31st of August, Amsterdam (limited availability)

  * 28th of September, Amsterdam
