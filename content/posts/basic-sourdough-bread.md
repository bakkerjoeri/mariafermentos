  ## Process

  1. Create the starter
     Your starter should be active, having been fed for at least the past  3 or 4 days. If it doubles in size around 2 hours after feeding, you’re good. Try to get about 200 grams of starter ready for baking.
  2. Mix and autolyse the dough (T+0)
     Mix your starter with the lukewarm water. Then mix and kneed to flower into it until you get a consistent mass. Cover the mixing bowl with a warm damp cloth, and store it somewhere slightly warm to keep the dough temparature at around 30 °C. Let the dough rest for 90 minutes.
  3. Mix in the salt (T+90 min)
     Dimple the mixture of salt and cold water into the dough, softly pushing it in to mix it evenly. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes.
  4. Stretch & fold 1 (T+10 min)
     Let the dough rest for 30 minutes between each stretch and fold step.
  5. Stretch & fold 2 (T+30 min)
     And again…
  6. Stretch & fold 3 (T+30 min)
     After this final stretch & fold, we rest the dough for about 15 minutes.
  7. Shape (T+15 min)
     Cut your dough in half using your dough scraper or a sharp knife. Quarter fold the dough and then do a tension pull to create the loaves. Put each loaf seam-side-up in a flowered proofing basket or a bowl lined with a dry, flowered, clean cloth. Flower the loaf some more. Let the loaves rest for about 20 minutes.
  8. Proving (T+20 min)
     Cover the baskets with a damp cloth and put them in the fridge for 8 to 12 hours.
  9. Baking (T+8 to 12 hours)
     Preheat the oven with a Dutch oven inside it to 250 °C. Turn the bread out onto a flowered surface and score it with a sharp knife. Put the loaf into the Dutch oven and put the Dutch oven into the oven with the lid on.  After 30 minutes, take the lid off, lower the heat to 230 °C and bake for another 30 minutes. Repeat for your second loaf.

  Leave each loaf to cool off for around 2 hours.
